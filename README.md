# remap-util
Utility for remapping keys on chromeOS devices for linux

Run using https://github.com/Lioncat6/ChromebookMegascript : 
`curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lioncat6/ChromebookMegascript/main/main.sh && sudo bash main.sh`

Run standalone (Not really recommended but should still work):
```
rm -rf remap-util
git clone https://github.com/Lioncat6/remap-util
cd remap-util 
sudo bash remap-util.sh
